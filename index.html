        <p><mark style="background-color:blue;">Joel <del>Prithard</del> Pritchard and Bill Bell </mark> came to the Pitchard house after playing golf one day in the year of 1965. They saw that the family was bored and had nothing to do. The family had an old badminton court, and decided to play there. However, the family could not find proper badminton equipment, and decided to use ping pong rackets and a plastic ball. They discovered that the ball bounced well on the surface of the court. This game the Pitchards and Bill played was soon known as a new sport;<mark style="font-size:20px"> <sup> Pickleball.</sup> </mark></p>

            <u><h3>Rules</h3></u>
            <p> The objective of Pickleball is to score 11 points before the other player(s). You do this by using your racket to hit the ball on the other side of the net. The rules are similar to tenis. If the ball crosses the net and bounces 2 times, then the player who hit it last gets a point. if it goes out of bounds, then the either it is a point for the other player, or the other player serves. But there is one area, which is called the kitchen. you can not hit the ball if it is in the kitchen. Otherwise, there is a right service area and a left service area. </p>
